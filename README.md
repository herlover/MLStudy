# MLStudy
Classification Sample

# Objective

I wanted to create this so I could have a sample code to apply to different databases and have multiple algorithms,
I also wanted to have my first side-project posted on here

# Using the code

The only thing that needs to be changed is the path to the database and the variable names if wanted, but otherwise everything is fine

It is supposed to also be a sample code for my personal study of how the algorithms work

# Hope someone sees this and enjoys it :)
